      "content": "Radiohead are an English rock band formed in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards); brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass); Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals); and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.\n\nRadiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, Pablo Honey, in 1993; their debut single, \"Creep\", became a worldwide hit. Radiohead's popularity and critical standing rose with the release of The Bends in 1995. Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the best albums in popular music.\n\nRadiohead's fourth album, Kid A (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though Kid A divided listeners, it later attracted wide acclaim. It was followed by Amnesiac (2001), recorded in the same sessions. Hail to the Thief (2003), with lyrics addressing the War on Terror, was Radiohead's final album for EMI.\n\nRadiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway, and O'Brien have released solo albums; in 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile.\n\nBy 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their awards include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and they hold five Mercury Prize nominations, the most of any act. Seven Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart: \"Creep\" (1992), \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" (1996), \"Paranoid Android\" (1997), \"Karma Police\" (1997), \"No Surprises\" (1998), \"Pyramid Song\" (2001), and \"There There\" (2003). \"Creep\" and \"Nude\" (2008) reached the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Rolling Stone named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and Rolling Stone readers voted them the second-best artist of the 2000s. Five Radiohead albums have been included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time lists. Radiohead were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead\n\nStudio albums\nPablo Honey (1993)\nThe Bends (1995)\nOK Computer (1997)\nKid A (2000)\nAmnesiac (2001)\nHail to the Thief (2003)\nIn Rainbows (2007)\nThe King of Limbs (2011)\nA Moon Shaped Pool (2016) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
